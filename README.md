# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Models
Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning (CNN + Transfer Learning) — A deep learning project that classifies lung CT scan images into Normal, Benign, and Malignant categories using models like MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 for early cancer detection and diagnosis assistance.

# 🩺 Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project applies **deep learning** techniques to detect and classify **lung cancer** from **CT scan images**.  
Using transfer learning models such as **MobileNetV2**, **InceptionV3**, and **ResNet50**, it predicts whether a scan is **Normal**, **Benign**, or **Malignant**, supporting early detection and diagnosis.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide.  
Early detection significantly improves survival rates.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **transfer learning** to automate image classification for lung cancer diagnosis.

## 🧠 Models Used
- **MobileNetV2** — Lightweight, efficient for real-time use.  
- **InceptionV3** — High-performing deep CNN architecture for image classification.  
- **ResNet50** — Residual connections help prevent vanishing gradients in deeper networks.  

Each model was fine-tuned on the **IQ-OTHNCCD Lung Cancer Dataset** from Kaggle.
